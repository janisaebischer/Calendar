# Calender for university tasks

## Purpose
The software is being developed to plan tasks and projects in a structured way. It allows each task to have a defined start time and to be displayed on a timeline. Additionally, tasks can have subtasks, and follow-up tasks can be created from them. Notifications can be added as reminders to ensure upcoming tasks are not overlooked. This enables tasks to be completed in the correct order, avoids overlaps, and improves overall organization and overview.

## First idea
Here are the first sketches. This is the initial concept to get started.

*This is my first project in this enviroment :) please have mercy*
